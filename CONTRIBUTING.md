### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to  [gueio@collabcode.tech](mailto:gueio@collabcode.tech).

### Issues and Questions

We have an official [Discord](https://discord.gg/YeeEAYj) server where we can give helpful advices if you have questions.

## How to submit a pull request?

1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/CollabCodeTech/collabcodetraining-frontend/fork).
2. Create a new branch with the feature name. (Eg: feature/chat-support, hotfix/website-header)
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes. Please follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
5. Push your changes.
6. Submit your pull request.

We use [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) so unless your PR is a `hotfix`, your feature branch must be created from the `develop` branch.

**TIP:** This [Git extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) makes Git Flow a piece of cake. GitKraken also has [built-in support](https://support.gitkraken.com/git-workflows-and-extensions/git-flow/) for GitFlow
